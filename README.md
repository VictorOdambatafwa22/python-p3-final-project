# LIBRARY MANAGEMENT SOFTWARE

#### Created on 06-09-2023

## Description
         A library is a collection of books,movies for reference purposes.
                                      
                                PROBLEM STATEMENT
I once visited our local polytechnic and found out the institution was not having an automated library management software. They were operating manually and this posed a lot of challenges which include the following

1. Difficulty in knowing total number of books the institution has in itâ€™s library.
2. Difficulty in keeping track of the books that have been borrowed
3. Difficulty in keeping track of books that have been borrowed and return date overdue.
4. Difficulty in penalizing students who have stayed with books past the required duration of time.
5. Difficulty in searching for a particular book .

                            SOLUTION TO THE ABOVE PROBLEMS
The automated system will offer the following solutions to the above problems.

1. All the books in the school will be registered in the database
2. All the students will be registered in the database
3. All the staff will be registered in the database
4. Ease of borrowing and returning of books
5. Ease of search of the book just by entering book ID(ISBN) or title of the book, category etc.
6. Keep track of borrowed books and the ones due for return.
7. Easy to penalize students who overstay with books
 

- **I have used the following concepts in coming up with the solution:**

  - SQLAlchemy Migrations
  
  - SQLAlchemy Relationships

  - Class and Instance Methods

  - SQLAlchemy Querying
